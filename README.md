This React app scratches the surface of the power of Socket.io. Using Socket.io, users can send a message to other users on the server. 

Here's how to get the app up and running:

git clone https://github.com/johnmalbert/JQZ-Developer-Playground
npm i
To install the dependencies:

```
npm install cors, dotenv, express, mongoose, socket.io,  nodemon
```

Start server on localhost:3000:
```
nodemon server.js
```
After Dependencies in project level have been installed, navigate to the client for the React elements:

```
cd client
npm install react, socket.io client, @reach/router  
npm start
```
